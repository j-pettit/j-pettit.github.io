      <h1>Julian Pettit</h1>
      <p>Hello stranger, friend, or peer, and welcome to my personal website. Please peruse this page at your lesure. If you are a potential business partner or employer, please consult my professional resources linked below. These will provide you with a snapshot of my education, qualifications, and network. If you wish for a glimpse at the life of a humble human like and unlike so many others, take a brief walk with me down the path of my life and gather from it what you will.</p>
      <h2>The question</h2>
      <p>What does it mean to be human? A quick google search gives the rather unsatisfying answer of <i>a human being, especially a person as distinguished from an animal or (in science fiction) an alien.</i> This is all very well and good, but really only shifts the burden of definition to <i>person</i>. Let us delve further. Unfortunately, this was destined to be a splash into a pond, rather than a graceful leap into a sea of mystery and understanding: The definition <i>a human being regarded as an individual</i> really just brings us back to where we started. I am philosopher by trade or education, but I am a thinker, and as such I believe I have the right to explore the question in a less literal meaning. That being said, rather then dwell on definitions, please join me in the exploration of my humanity, and the driving force behind my actions.</p>
